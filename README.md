Supplementing thyroid hormone deficiency with levothyroxine (LT4) has become the standard of care after a total thyroidectomy. 
A thyroidectomy has become a common treatment for various hyperthyroid diseases; this has led to extensive studies of proper LT4 dosing.
Historically, LT4 dosing is based on the patient’s body weight (BW), with the most common oral dose of LT4 being 1.6ug/kg/day. 
This dose is assuming that there are no malabsorption problems or ionic supplements being taken for other metabolic imbalances. 
Using this dosing scheme, some patients are over-prescribed and some are under-prescribed, creating the need for follow up appointments to check thyroid stimulating hormone levels (TSH). 
T4 levels regulate the amount of TSH in the body and TSH levels between .5-5 mU/L correspond to normal T4 and T3 levels in the rest of the body. 
In order to correctly dose patients with proper amounts of LT4 on the first try, researchers have looked in to other correlations between optimal LT4 dosing and other anthropometric measurements including: body surface area (BSA), body mass index (BMI), lean body mass (LBM), sex and age. 
This project shows the results of a literature search through modern dosing algorithms being developed by various researchers and includes the implementation of these algorithms into a thyroid hormone simulation application called “Thyrosim”
